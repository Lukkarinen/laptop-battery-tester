# Laptop Battery Tester
 A program that cycles a laptop's battery from full to empty to full again to test its health.

 Currently does not have proper logging and instead just prints stats to terminal three times per second.

 Planned features:
 - logging to file
 - support for automatically cutting power with a custom USB device
 - GUI
